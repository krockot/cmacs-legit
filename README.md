Cmacs
=====

What is? Nobody know.

Building
--------

To build Cmacs, Python and Java should both be in your executable path.

You can build without optimizations:

    python build/build.py debug

or if you want advanced optimization and a generated zipfile, you can present
an output version number instead:

    python build/build.py 0.1.2.3

The version given will be embedded in the app's packaged manifest.

Testing
-------

Once everything is built, you can run the test server:

    python test/test_server.py

This will serve JsUnit tests over HTTP on port 4444.

Test rely on an `out/deps.js` file generated by the build script. If you change
any JS dependencies, you may need to rebuild to get tests working.
