Cmacs
=====

What is? Nobody know.

Building
--------

To build Cmacs, Python and Java should both be in your executable path.

Run:

    python build/build.py

if you want advanced optimization. For no advanced optimization:

    python build/build.py debug

Testing
-------

Once everything is built, you can run the test server:

    python test/test_server.py

This will serve JsUnit tests over HTTP on port 4444.

Tests rely on an `out/deps.js` file generated by the build script. If you change
any JS dependencies, you may need to rebuild to get tests working.

Serving
-------

Here's a stupid little test server which serves the app:

    python server/app_server.py

This serves some kind of UI over HTTP on port 4242.
